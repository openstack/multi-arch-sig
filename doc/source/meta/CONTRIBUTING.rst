Contributing to OpenStack's Multi-Arch SIG
=============================================

If you would like to participate in discussions or contribute in any
way to the design and development of Multi-Arch in OpenStack, please
first see the following etherpad to understand the SIG's mission, scope,
and other supporting information:

  https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Multi-arch

Many forms of contribution are valuable to the community, including but not
limited to the following:

- `Documentation`, including implementation details if available
- `Code`
- `Discussions` on all the above and other topics

Everyone is warmly encouraged to get involved in whatever capacity you
see fit.

Discussions
-----------

Discussions take place:

- on `the openstack-discuss mailing list
  <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss>`_
  with ``[Multi-Arch-sig]`` in the Subject header,
- `the SIG's storyboard
  <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/openstack/Multi-Arch-sig>`_,
- `Meeting <http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/#Multi-Arch_SIG_Meeting>_`

Use cases
---------

The SIG serves to facilitate the discussion and documentation of Multi-Arch
use cases at all stages of development from a seed idea to a fully tested use
case.

To call attention to a use case, please start the discussion in `one
of the established communication channels <#discussions>`_.

See `Submitting a change`_ for more information.

Code
----

The Multi-Arch-sig repository also holds any relevant
cross-project code, tests, and documentation that do not naturally
belong in a single project repository.

See `Submitting a change`_ for more information.
